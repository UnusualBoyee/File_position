# File_position
Shows according to given START and END position.

Can modify and distributed. Without anyone's permision.

# CONCEPT
If you want to check certain position from a file. You can easily get the position, ascii value and following character.

# INFO
First you have to `uncomment` the main.
Cause there are two main present in file.
One for reading from actual file.
Another for reading from buffer.

If you compile without `uncommenting` you will get "undefined refrence to main" err.

# COMPILE
gcc f_check.c

# RUN PROCESS
./(char *str) (file name)

# MAIL (REPORT BUG / REQUEST "how did" / REPORT NOT MAINTAINED CODE PROPERLY)
