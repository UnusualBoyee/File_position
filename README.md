# File_position
Shows according to given START and END position.

Can modify and distributed. Without anyone's permision.

# CONCEPT
If you want to check certain position from a file. You can easily get the position, ascii value and following character.

# INFO
First you have to `uncomment` the main.
Cause there are two main present in file.
One for reading from actual file.
Another for reading from buffer.

If you compile without `uncommenting` you will get "undefined refrence to main" err.

DIFFERENT BETWEEN THEM 

: ONE READ FROM COUNTING 0 AND ANOTHER READS FROM 1.
: "Pending"
